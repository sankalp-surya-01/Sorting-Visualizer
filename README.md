# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A modern, interactive web application that visualizes various sorting algorithms in real-time. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work through visual representation.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- **Interactive Controls**
  - Adjustable array size (5 to 500 elements)
  - Variable sorting speed (Slow/Moderate/Fast)
  - Real-time visualization
  - Start and Reset functionality

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Number of comparisons
  - Number of swaps
  - Execution time

- **User Interface**
  - Modern, clean design
  - Dark/Light mode toggle
  - Responsive layout
  - Interactive bars
  - Visual feedback during sorting

## 🎨 Color Scheme

The application uses a carefully selected color palette:
- Primary Blue: `#023047`
- Accent Yellow: `#FFB703`
- Accent Orange: `#FB8500`
- Secondary Blue: `#219EBC`
- Light Blue: `#8ECAE6`

## 🚀 Usage

1. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu
2. Choose the array size (5-500 elements)
3. Select the sorting speed
4. Click "START" to begin visualization
5. Use "RESET" to generate a new array

## 💻 Technical Details

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: O(n²) - Compares adjacent elements
- **Insertion Sort**: O(n²) - Builds sorted array one item at a time
- **Selection Sort**: O(n²) - Finds minimum element in unsorted portion
- **Merge Sort**: O(n log n) - Divide and conquer algorithm
- **Quick Sort**: O(n log n) - Partition-based sorting

### Performance Tracking
- Real-time comparison counter
- Swap operations counter
- Millisecond-precise timer

## 🌙 Dark Mode

The application includes a dark mode toggle for comfortable viewing in low-light conditions, with carefully selected colors for optimal contrast and readability.

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Fully responsive layout
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
